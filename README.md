## Summary
My own version of a popular old school 2D game Bomberman created with Unity engine (C#).

## Installation
If you want look inside of this project, you need to have **[Unity](https://unity.com/)** installed. If you have that, clone this repository to your computer and in Unity Hub select ``ADD`` and choose the folder ``Bomberman`` (this might vary depending on version). Then just open the created Bomberman project. If you want to play, select ``Menu`` scene and click the play button in Unity Editor.

**If you don't have Unity but still want to play, you can play in your browser [here](https://connect.unity.com/mg/other/bomberman-2).**
